Programming language based on experimental mouse breeding
Start out with 2 default mice, both of value 1
To create other values, must breed. Offspring are addition of parent mice.
Always 2 offspring. 
To print a value as a char,, kill mouse
to read a value, "import" mouse (as in from another facility)
You can have multiple facilities?
to subtract, mice fight. Bigger mouse wins but sustains injuries, thus is
equal to Big - Small. Small mouse dies, but is not output?
Mice have numeric labels and generation labels. Imported mice always have
generation label 0
Mice can die of old age after x cycles/instructions?
OR
mutate: by default when mice breed they do a + operation. However, you can
mutate a mouse to do a - or / operation, where offspring = MutatedMouse -|/
NormalMouse
OR you can have 1 facility for each arithmetic operation?
This does not look stack-based
