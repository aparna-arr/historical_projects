Genetic Algorithm terrarium
Multiple (2) "animals"
predator and prey evolution
background rate of mutation
player can introduce mutagen
player can introduce randomly placed new animal -- predator or prey

first try
random movements, variable speeds of predator and prey
2 degrees of mutation : percent of things mutated, max mutation
several stats per animal : predator or prey, defense, attack, speed all of which can be mutated
animals reproduce via probability and two animals of the same type being near to each other
completely filling up (or filling up to some degree of unmoving animals) the terrarium results in 50 - 75% instant (random) death
each reproduction includes crossovers
predator next to prey results in death (of some probability depending on defense/attack of both) of prey
randomized old age death (low)
terrarrium of a specified, fixed size. Animals cannot move into or beyond walls, if they try they stay in the same spot
