Board, controller, pieces
controller knows which spaces are valid and invalid.
Asks piece for a move: randomize pieces and ask for a move from first from
shuffled list.

Pieces can generate valid ideal moves
-> given a list of unoccupied spaces? Then generate a valid move, else return
NULL (no valid move possible for that piece). 
-> determine which of these spaces could be a valid move, shuffle, return the
move.

global shuffle function: given an array and a size, return a shuffled array
(fisher-?? shuffle)

controller recalculates open spaces (or removes)
